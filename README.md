### Introduction
Hi, I am Arnav Batra pursuing Computer Science engineering at Bennett University. I recently started my journey in programming as a coder in general and I am curruntly exploring the various fundamental aspects of programming specifically in Python. 
I am doing so by solving the problems of the Euler project. 
I have also taken up CS50X by David J. Malan.
